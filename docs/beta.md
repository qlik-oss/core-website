amount in dispute clearly exceeds the amount set forth above, the Rules
of the SCC Institute shall apply and the arbitral tribunal shall be

damages alone may not necessarily be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
the Licensee hereby acknowledges, that except as provided in this

specific performance or other equitable relief in favor of the Licensee
is an appropriate and necessary remedy for breach of the terms of this
Agreement.

Agreement and for a one year period thereafter, Qlik may audit, upon
reasonable notice to Licensee and at Qlik’s expense, Licensee’s relevant

become subject. No term of this Agreement shall be deemed waived and no
breach or default excused unless such waiver or excuse shall be in
writing and signed by the Party issuing the same.

7.11. <span class="underline">Limitation to bring Action.</span> No
action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement may be brought
by Licensee more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.

7.12. <span class="underline">Non-Waivable Rights</span>. Nothing
included in this Agreement shall limit any non-waivable right to
decompile the Software that the Licensee may enjoy under mandatory law.
For example, if the Licensee is located in the European Union (EU),
Licensee may have the right upon certain conditions specified to
decompile the Software if it is necessary to do so in order to achieve
interoperability of the Software with another software program, and the
Licensee has first asked Qlik in writing to provide the information
necessary to achieve such interoperability and Qlik has not made such
information available. In addition, such decompilation may only be done
by the Licensee. Qlik has the right to impose reasonable conditions
before providing such information. Any information supplied by Qlik or
obtained by Licensee, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by the
Licensee for the purpose described herein and may not be disclosed to
any third party or used to create any software which is substantially
similar to the expression of the Software or used for any other act
which infringes Qlik’s or its licensors’ copyright.

7.13. <span class="underline">Marketing.</span> During the term of this
Agreement, Licensee shall use endeavor to:

i) Provide Qlik with applicable quotes for use by Qlik (including in

quotes and press releases;

ii) Participate in media opportunities, including those involving
interviews, that may be used by Qlik for marketing purposes;

iii) Participate in calls or face-to-face meetings to share details of
the Qlik Core experience and or participate in analyst events/surveys;

and/or partners to promote successful Qlik Core testing and development
experience; and

v) Allow Qlik to prepare a case study related to the Licensee’s use of
the Software and distribute this internally within Qlik and externally
including on Qlik.com, Qlik collateral and Qlik newsletters.
