      *   The Engine will send many DownloadRequest messages.
      *
      *   The first DownloadRequest message is the file name to download.
      *   If the file is not available, the connector can return an error
      *   immediately.
      *
      *   The following DownloadRequest messages asks for the file content
      *   at random offsets. (Though they will often but not always
      *   be serial).
      *
      *   The Engine will often ask for a few megabytes of data at the time.
      *   But if the Engine knows that it will do a perfectly linear read, it
      *   may send one read request for all the file content. That could be a
      *   lot of data, which will have to send back in many DownloadResponse
      *   messages.
      *
      *   The best bandwidth is achieved if most DownloadResponse messages
      *   are 64K or slightly less. But tests show that anywhere from 10K
      *   to 120K gives almost as good performance. The size of an
      *   DownloadResponse message is the size of the data and a small
      *   protocol overhead.
      *
      *   When the Engine will not make any more data requests, it will
      *   call WritesDone() and the connector will get no more
      *   DownloadRequest messages.
      *
      *   When WritesDone() is called by the Engine, the connector
      *   will continue to send the data already requested.
      *
      *   The Engine may call TryCancel() at any time for a variety
      *   of reasons. Typically, when analyzing files for the file
      *   wizard API or when script errors happen.
      *
      *   When the Connector is streaming back data, it should check
      *   often if the rpc is canceled. If canceled,
      *   the Connector should stop sending more data and return
      *   CANCELLED on the request.
      *
      *   If the connector don't receive a TryCancel() call, it will
      *   typically return OK as status code after Engine has called
      *   WritesDone() and the Connector returned all requested data.
      *
      *   At the very end, Engine will call Finish() to retrieve the
      *   status code for the call. This is used for error handling
      *   and trouble shooting.
