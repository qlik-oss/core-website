# June 2019

Welcome to the June 2019 Qlik Core update. There are a number of updates in this version that we hope you will like,
some of the key highlights include:

## New features in corectl

Since the launch of corectl we have received a couple of feature request from our users which we love to implement.
Thank you Jesse Paris for all your feedback!

The new version [1.2.0](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl/releases/tag/v1.2.0) includes all the latest features.
As always, you can get the latest by using `brew upgrade`, `snap refresh` or downloading from
[GitHub](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl/releases).

### Connect to Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows with certificates

If you would like to connect to Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows using certificates (instead of JWT validation) we have
added support through the new certificates parameter. To enable this, create new certificates in your Qlik Sense
Environment. Export them to a location where corectl can reference them and add the `--certificates` to
your corectl parameters.

As an example, you can list a user's application by:

```bash
corectl --engine wss://<qlik-sense-url>:4747 --certificates <certfolder> --headers "X-Qlik-User: UserDirectory=<userdir>; UserId=<userid>" app ls
```

```txt
+--------------------------------------+------+--------------------------+----------+-------+
|                  Id                  | Name |      Last-Reloaded       | ReadOnly | Title |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------------------------+----------+-------+
| ea39af16-e6bb-4aa5-bea3-3386b6ef307b | test | 2019-06-26T08:30:34.155Z | false    | test  |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------------------------+----------+-------+
```

To keep the command shorter, the configuration can be placed in a corectl.yml file. You can read more about the feature
in the [corectl config](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl/blob/master/docs/corectl_config.md#certificates) chapter.

### Unbuild - export app content

![screenshot](../images/corectl-unbuild.gif)

The new experimental command, `unbuild`, exports all dimensions, measures, objects, variables, connections and load
script from an existing application. As an example, this might be valuable when you who want to use existing objects in multiple
applications or if you would like to extract and version manage application content outside the app
itself.

Usage:

```bash
corectl unbuild -a app-id
```

This will create a new folder named `app-id-unbuild`. If you would like to use another directory just add `--dir` to
your command

```bash
corectl unbuild --dir ./output -a app-id
```

### Variables and bookmarks

We have extended support for application entities to include variables and bookmarks. Variables follow the same structure
as other advanced commands (`layout`, `ls`, `properties`, `rm`, `set`). Bookmarks is similar but lacks the `set` command.

Example showing properties for a specified variable:

```bash
corectl variable properties vRunningDate -a "Helpdesk Management.qvf"
```

```json
{
  "qInfo": {
    "qId": "4b551465-809d-401b-9a82-aabcd892eab4",
    "qType": "variable"
  },
  "qMetaDef": {},
  "qName": "vRunningDate",
  "qNumberPresentation": {
    "qType": "U",
    "qnDec": 10,
    "qUseThou": 0
  },
  "qDefinition": "=maxstring([Running Date])"
}
```

### Import applications

Do you have a couple of Qlik applications you would like to try out in a new Qlik Core container? Do you want to
automate importing application to an engine instance? The new import command might be helpful for you. The command
imports a specified application to the engine and returns its provided ID.

Usage:

```bash
$ corectl app import path/app.qvf
Imported app with new ID: a0334b7f-e533-4643-9e8c-0e8b6f9fdc84
```

### Basic completion support for powershell

For those of you favoring Powershell, we have added basic completion support. With the completion enabled you can cycle
through the available commands and flags for current command.

Please look into the [https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl#powershell](readme) for more information.

### Other fixes

* Bash completion suggest files based on required file types (e.g. *.json for objects)

## Resize columns in catwalk

![screenshot](../images/catwalk-resize-tables.gif)

Sometimes, fields, tables and values have long names which makes it hard to distinguish them from each other. In order
to fix this we introduced table resizing. After a table size has been changed, the value will be stored in the
browser's local storage and used when returning to the application in the future.
